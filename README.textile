h1. memnomic (mem-nom-ic): the handy memory eater

This is a simple utility to allocate and lock a specified amount of RAM.  It should theoretically compile and work on 64-bit *nix systems that support mlockall(2).

*Usage:* memnomic _amount_of_RAM_to_gobble_

The RAM amount may be specified as a number of bytes, or via the following shorthand suffixes:

* 'G' for GiB, e.g. "4G" (4*1024*1024*1024)
* 'M' for MiB
* 'K' for KiB

h2. Caveats

* No 32-bit support.  Easy to add.
